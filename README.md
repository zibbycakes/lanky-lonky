A discord bot for running mafia games

NOTE: the bot will not run without a .env file. This file contains secrets for the discord bot token, the dynamodb endpoint url, and the discord server (guild) name. As a security precaution, as well as for the sake of possibly expanding this bot out to other servers, this file has not been added to the repo.
